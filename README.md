# Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator

## Overview
This project is an arbitrary-precision integer calculator implemented in Python without relying on any external libraries for core functionality. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with modulo), and advanced functions like exponentiation and factorial. The tool is wrapped in a REPL for easy user interaction.

## Features
- **Addition**: Supports addition of large numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Works for both small and large numbers.
- **Division**: Supports division with arbitrary precision.
- **Modulo**: Find the remainder when dividing numbers.
- **Exponentiation**: Calculate large powers.
- **Factorial**: Compute the factorial of large numbers.
- **Base Handling**: Support for binary (0b), octal (0o), and hexadecimal (0x) numbers.
- **Interactive command-line interface (REPL)

## Installation
To run this calculator, ensure that Python is installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/valentinenyongesa/arbitrary-precision-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd arbitrary-precision-calculator
    ```

3. Run the calculator:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the program is running, use the REPL to input expressions, such as:
- `5 + 10`
- `20 * 15`
- `5!`
- `10 + 0b101`

## Contributing
