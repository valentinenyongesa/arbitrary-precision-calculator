# Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator

Welcome to the **Arbitrary Precision Integer Calculator**! This project implements a calculator capable of performing arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations on integers of arbitrary size. The calculator is written in Python, without relying on any built-in libraries or external dependencies for its core functionality.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
- **Advanced Operations**: Exponentiation and factorial.
- **Arbitrary Precision**: Handles integers of any size, far exceeding typical data type limits.
- **Interactive REPL**: Users can interact with the calculator via a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) interface.
- **Bonus Support** (if implemented):
  - Non-decimal bases (binary, hexadecimal, etc.).
  - Fractional representation.
  - Logarithmic operations.
